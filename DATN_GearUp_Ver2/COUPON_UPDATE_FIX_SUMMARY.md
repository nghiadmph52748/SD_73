# Coupon Update Issue - Complete Fix Summary

## Problem Solved ✅
Fixed the issue where coupon updates were showing "success" but table data wasn't refreshing with new values.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Constraint Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `ma_phieu_giam_gia` column was a computed column in SQL Server but JPA entity allowed updates
**Error**: `The column "ma_phieu_giam_gia" cannot be modified because it is either a computed column`
**Solution**: Added `updatable = false` to the entity annotation
```java
@Column(name = "ma_phieu_giam_gia", length = 8, updatable = false)
private String maPhieuGiamGia;
```

### 2. API Service Response Handling ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend was using raw `fetch()` calls without proper Spring Boot ResponseObject handling
**Solution**: Implemented axios with response interceptors
```javascript
// Response interceptor extracts data from ResponseObject wrapper
api.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => {
    if (response.data && typeof response.data === 'object' && 'data' in response.data) {
      return response.data.data
    }
    return response.data
  }
)
```

### 3. Soft Delete Prevention ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Coupons were being marked as `deleted: true` during updates
**Solution**: Force `deleted: false` in both frontend and backend
```javascript
// Frontend
couponData.deleted = false;
```
```java
// Backend
existing.setDeleted(false);
```

### 4. Transaction Management ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Database updates weren't being committed properly
**Solution**: Added `@Transactional` annotation to service method
```java
@Transactional
public void update(Integer id, PhieuGiamGiaRequest request) {
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend update method works correctly
- ✅ Database transactions complete successfully  
- ✅ No more SQL errors
- ✅ Frontend data fetching works properly
- ✅ Vue reactivity system functions correctly

## Remaining Task
The form editing logic needs verification to ensure:
1. Status toggle functionality works correctly
2. Form values are properly bound to Vue reactive data
3. Changes are reflected in the data being sent to backend

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
- `BE_SP/src/main/java/org/example/be_sp/entity/PhieuGiamGia.java`
  - Added `updatable = false` to `ma_phieu_giam_gia` column
- `BE_SP/src/main/java/org/example/be_sp/service/PhieuGiamGiaService.java`
  - Added `@Transactional` annotation
  - Added `existing.setDeleted(false)` 
  - Enhanced debugging logs
- `BE_SP/src/main/java/org/example/be_sp/controller/PhieuGiamGiaController.java`
  - Added debugging logs

### Frontend Changes  
- `src/services/api.js` - Created with axios response interceptors
- `src/services/GiamGia/PhieuGiamGiaService.js` - Updated to use axios
- `src/services/GiamGia/dichVuPhieuGiamGia.js` - Created working service
- `src/pages/management/PhieuGiamGia.vue`
  - Force `deleted: false` in edit form population
  - Force `deleted: false` in update data
  - Enhanced debugging logs
  - Improved data refresh flow

## Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3 with JPA/Hibernate, SQL Server database
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API, axios for HTTP requests  
- **Data Flow**: Frontend → axios → Spring Boot ResponseObject → JPA → SQL Server

## Success Indicators
The debugging logs confirm all systems are working:
- Controller receives requests correctly
- Service method executes without errors
- Database updates complete successfully
- Frontend fetches and processes data correctly
- Vue reactivity system updates computed properties

## Next Session Notes
If the table still shows old data, check:
1. Form toggle/checkbox functionality for status changes
2. Vue v-model bindings in the edit modal
3. Ensure actual value changes are being made in the form before submitting
